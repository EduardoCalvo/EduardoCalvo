### Hi, I'm Eduardo!
I aim to pursue a career in software development and contribute to research groups focused on computer science and mathematical applications.

🎓 Math undergrad at CIMAT with a strong focus on computer science.<br/>
💻 I enjoy building things that solve real problems — from simulating online stores in C++ to modeling species extinction using Julia and R.<br/>
🧠 Passionate about algorithms, graph theory, machine learning, and anything that mixes deep thinking with clean code.<br/>
🍬 Once built a Skittles-sorting machine with Arduino just for fun.<br/>
📁 This is where I share personal projects, experiments, and ideas I'm curious about. Welcome!<br/>
